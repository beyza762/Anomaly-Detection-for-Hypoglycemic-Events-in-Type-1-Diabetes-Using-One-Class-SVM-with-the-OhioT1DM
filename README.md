# Anomaly-Detection-for-Hypoglycemic-Events-in-Type-1-Diabetes-Using-One-Class-SVM-with-the-OhioT1DM-Dataset
Diabetes mellitus, especially Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), poses significant health challenges, with hypoglycemic events being a major concern. This study aimed to improve the prediction of hypoglycemic events using an One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) model applied to the OhioT1DM dataset, which contains extensive physiological data from patients with T1DM. The OC-SVM model was trained on normal glucose levels (> 70 mg/dL) to detect deviations indicative of hypoglycemia. Despite the model’s broad anomaly detection capabilities, accurately defining hypoglycemic events strictly as glucose levels below 70 mg/dL was difficult due to dataset limitations, including missing values, imbalanced data, and high dimensionality. The evaluation metrics highlighted the need for more precise anomaly definitions and improved data quality. Future research should refine these aspects and incorporate additional data sources to enhance early detection capabilities. This study offers insights into advancing anomaly detection and predictive modeling for T1D management.\end{abstract}

Conlusion:
In summary, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the One-Class SVM model for detecting hypoglycemic anomalies in Type 1 Diabetes patients, despite challenges with dataset quality and anomaly definition. The model’s ability to identify a broad range of anomalies underscores the need for more precise criteria and improved data. Addressing these challenges through advanced modeling techniques and enhanced datasets will be essential for achieving more accurate and reliable early detection, ultimately improving patient outcomes and diabetes management strategies.
